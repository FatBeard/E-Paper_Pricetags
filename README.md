## 11.6" Version
- To use it with Arduino and GxEPD2 copy the modded library into your Arduino library folder and open the GxEPD2_Example and uncomment the GxEPD2_1160c display, its under ESP32 section, if you want to use it with a different Arduino you need to copy it or edit it for that one / pinout

- To modify the stock pcb take a look at my video manual: https://youtu.be/c62D3Z-c5IM
